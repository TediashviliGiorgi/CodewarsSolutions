All Star Code Challenge #22

Create a function that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.

Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.

Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"

For example:

3600 --> "1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)"
3601 --> "1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)"
3500 --> "0 hour(s) and 58 minute(s)"
323500 --> "89 hour(s) and 51 minute(s)"

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
Kata.HighAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
Kata.HighAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
Kata.HighAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

DESCRIPTION:
Story
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

Examples (Input --> Output)
[1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
[2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
[1]         --> [1,1]
Remarks
All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

sol4

DESCRIPTION:
Task
We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only 
one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. 
This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the
number and round it to 0 or to 10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 
if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding to 10 means
increasing the next significant digit by 1). The process stops immediately 
once there is only one non-zero digit left.

Example
For value = 15, the output should be 20

For value = 1234, the output should be 1000.

1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.

For value = 1445, the output should be 2000.

1445 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 2000.

Input/Output
[input] integer value

A positive integer.

Constraints: 1 ≤ value ≤ 108

[output] an integer

The rounded number.

sol5

DESCRIPTION:
You are going to be given a string. Your job is to return that string in a certain order that I will explain below:

Let's say you start with this: "012345"

The first thing you do is reverse it:"543210"
Then you will take the string from the 1st position and reverse it again:"501234"
Then you will take the string from the 2nd position and reverse it again:"504321"
Then you will take the string from the 3rd position and reverse it again:"504123"

Continue this pattern until you have done every single position,
and then you will return the string you have created. For this particular number, you would return:"504132"

Input:
A string of length 1 - 1000

Output:
A correctly reordered string.

sol6

DESCRIPTION:
In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example
ListFilterer.GetIntegersFromList(new List<object>(){1, 2, "a", "b"}) => {1, 2}
ListFilterer.GetIntegersFromList(new List<object>(){1, 2, "a", "b", 0, 15}) => {1, 2, 0, 15}
ListFilterer.GetIntegersFromList(new List<object>(){1, 2, "a", "b", "aasf", "1", "123", 231}) => {1, 2, 231}

I have a cat and a dog which I got as kitten / puppy.

I forget when that was, but I do know their current ages as catYears and dogYears.

Find how long I have owned each of my pets and return as a list [ownedCat, ownedDog]

NOTES:

Results are truncated whole numbers of "human" years
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

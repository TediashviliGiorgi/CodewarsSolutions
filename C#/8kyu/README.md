Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. 
The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. 
Your function only needs to return the result, 
what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it,
see the sample tests.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)



Sol2
-----------------
DESCRIPTION:
Create a function that accepts a string and a single character, and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

("Hello", "o")  ==>  1
("Hello", "l")  ==>  2
("", "z")       ==>  0
str_count("Hello", 'o'); // returns 1
str_count("Hello", 'l'); // returns 2
str_count("", 'z'); // returns 0
Notes
The first argument can be an empty string
In languages with no distinct character data type, the second argument will be a string of length 1



Sol3
-----------------
Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and an optional margin. The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b.

Please note the following:

When a is close to b, return 0.
For this challenge, a is considered "close to" b if margin is greater than or equal to the absolute distance between a and b.
Otherwise...

When a is less than b, return -1.

When a is greater than b, return 1.

If margin is not given, treat it as if it were zero.

Assume: margin >= 0

Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.



Sol4
-----------------
DESCRIPTION:
Task
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

Mind the input validation.

Example
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
Input validation
If an empty value ( null, None, Nothing etc. ) is given instead of an array, or the given array is an empty list or a list with only 1 element, return 0.



Sol5
DESCRIPTION:
You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

DESCRIPTION:
Create a function that returns the CSV representation of a two-dimensional numeric array.

Example:

input:
   [[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
    [ 10,11,12,13,14 ],
    [ 20,21,22,23,24 ],
    [ 30,31,32,33,34 ]] 
    
output:
     '0,1,2,3,4\n'
    +'10,11,12,13,14\n'
    +'20,21,22,23,24\n'
    +'30,31,32,33,34'
Array's length > 2.

DESCRIPTION:
Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. 
Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]

DESCRIPTION:
Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

"I love you"
"a little"
"a lot"
"passionately"
"madly"
"not at all"
If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.

When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.

-----------------
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. 
The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

Examples
Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
Output: 9.2

Input: []
Output: 0

Input: [-2.398]
Output: -2.398

Assumptions
You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.



Sol10

DESCRIPTION:
You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. 
You know that there are a certain number there (n), 
but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, 
he has to start counting them from 1.

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. 
Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, 
but excluding zero.

For example(Input --> Output):

10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 1 --> [1]

DESCRIPTION:
Jack really likes his number five: the trick here is that you have to multiply each number by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers, so, for example:

multiply(3) == 15 # 3 * 5¹
multiply(10) == 250 # 10 * 5²
multiply(200) == 25000 # 200 * 5³
multiply(0) == 0 # 0 * 5¹
multiply(-3) == -15 # -3 * 5¹

-----------------
DESCRIPTION:
To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer

DESCRIPTION:
Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.

Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

Examples
"1234" --> 1234
"605"  --> 605
"1405" --> 1405
"-7" --> -7

Make multiple functions that will return the sum, difference, modulus, product, quotient, and the exponent respectively.

Please use the following function names:

addition = Add

multiply = Multiply

division = Divide

modulus = Mod

exponential = Exponent

subtraction = Subt

Note: All funcitons can return int and all will recieve 2 integers.

Note: All math operations will be: a (operation) b

DESCRIPTION:
There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars 
is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (≥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

-----------------
Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. 
Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x)
got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

Sol18
-----------------
In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , 
and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, 
limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. 
There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, 
not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return 
[2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.
